        which fairness-assigned spawn slot a roster lands on across repeated

        Deterministic and stateless (no persisted counter, no hash/random,

        consecutive integers, which for any `N` in-round episodes form a

        advances (never resets to 0) as `round_number` increases, so a
        roster that keeps landing at the same episode position across
        comparable rounds still keeps rotating through every fairness slot

        Assumption (documented, not enforced here): the modular alignment
        with a specific prior round's rotation is only guaranteed while
        comparable rounds (same map/roster) keep the SAME per-round episode
        count. A ladder/pool change that alters the count between rounds
        still never repeats an exact (base, position) pair - so it can
        never silently replay history - it just starts a new local residue
